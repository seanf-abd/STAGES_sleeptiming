# STAGES_test
Attempted workflow for STAGES dataset, all dirs are local atm so this will have to be updated in time. Will also look at integrating NSRR user interface on Ruby. 

STAGES_workflow.Rmd is the markdown doc used to pre-process and analyze all actigraphy data. 

STAGES_PSG.Rmd is the markdown doc used to extract PSG parameters from scored .csv files. 

STAGES_plot.Rmd is the doc used to run statistical analyses on final dataset and compute graphs
